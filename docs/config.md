# Config Reference — `.base/config.yaml`

Every app can define environment-specific configuration in `.base/config.yaml`. Global settings apply to all environments; per-environment sections override them.

## Full Example

```yaml
environments:
  # Global env vars — applied to every environment
  global:
    env:
      - name: PORT
        value: '3000'
      - name: HOSTNAME
        value: '0.0.0.0'

  stage:
    replicas: 1
    containerPort: 3000              # default, can be omitted
    healthCheckPath: /api/health     # optional: HTTP readiness probe
    startupGracePeriod: 90           # optional: seconds to wait for startup (default 300)
    resources:
      requests: { cpu: 100m, memory: 128Mi }
      limits:   { cpu: 250m, memory: 256Mi }
    env:
      - name: LOG_LEVEL
        value: debug

  stage-preview:                     # Overrides applied during staged (canary) deploys on stage
    env:
      - name: DEBUG
        value: 'true'

  prod:
    replicas: 2
    healthCheckPath: /api/health
    startupGracePeriod: 90
    is_private: false                # default false — set true for internal-only (no public endpoint)
    force_https: true                # default false — 301 plain HTTP to HTTPS
    resources:
      requests: { cpu: 500m,  memory: 1.5Gi }
      limits:   { cpu: 2000m, memory: 3Gi }
    autoscaling:                     # See docs/scaling.md
      enabled: true
      minReplicas: 2
      maxReplicas: 10
      behaviorPreset: gradual
      triggers:
        - type: cpu
          utilizationPercentage: 60
    env:
      - name: LOG_LEVEL
        value: warn

  prod-preview:                      # Staged-deploy overrides on prod
    env:
      - name: CANARY_METRICS
        value: 'enabled'

  # PR scope — not an environment, a config template for PR previews
  pr:
    inherits: stage                  # Use stage as the base
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      limits: { cpu: 250m, memory: 256Mi }
    env:
      - name: PREVIEW
        value: 'true'
```

## Resolution

| Scenario | Config vars resolved from |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Named environment deploy | `global` + `<env>` |
| Staged (canary) deploy | `global` + `<env>` + `<env>-preview` |
| PR environment | `global` + `<inherited-env>` + `pr` |

## Keys

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `replicas` | Fixed replica count when autoscaling is disabled. |
| `containerPort` | Port the app listens on (default `3000`). |
| `healthCheckPath` | HTTP readiness probe path. Omit to use a TCP port check (safe for auth-protected apps). |
| `startupGracePeriod` | Seconds to wait before failing the startup probe (default `300`, range `10–900`). Increase for slow-start apps. |
| `is_private` | `true` hides the environment from the public internet — no public endpoint, no DNS. See [Internal-Only Deployments](#internal-only-deployments). |
| `force_https` | `true` answers plain HTTP with a 301 to the HTTPS URL. Default `false`, which serves both. See [Forcing HTTPS](#forcing-https). |
| `resources.requests` / `resources.limits` | CPU and memory reservations. |
| `autoscaling` | Autoscaling rules — see [docs/scaling.md](scaling.md). |
| `env` | List of `{ name, value }` environment variables. Values are always stringified — `value: 3000` and `value: '3000'` behave identically. |

## Environment Variable Merging

- `environments.global.env` is merged into every deploy. Globals show up separately in the portal Config tab.
- Per-environment `env` entries override globals with the same `name`.
- Staged deploys add a third merge layer from `<env>-preview`.

## PR Environments

The `environments.pr` section is a **config template**, not a named environment. Use `inherits` to base the template on a named environment:

```yaml
environments:
  stage:
    replicas: 2
    env:
      - name: LOG_LEVEL
        value: info

  pr:
    inherits: stage       # PRs start from stage config
    replicas: 1           # override
    env:
      - name: PREVIEW
        value: 'true'
```

Every PR gets its own isolated environment named `pr-<number>`, auto-created when the PR opens and auto-deleted when it closes.

Pattern names that auto-route through the `pr` template: `pr-*`, `preview-*`, `feature-*`, `branch-*`.

## Internal-Only Deployments

Set `is_private: true` for apps that should not be reachable from the public internet (internal APIs, bots, background services):

```yaml
environments:
  prod:
    is_private: true
    replicas: 2
    env:
      - name: PORT
        value: '3000'
```

When `is_private: true`:

- No public endpoint, no DNS, no HTTPS certificate
- Staged deploys use instance-based canary (replica scaling) instead of traffic splitting
- The app is only reachable from other apps in the same organization via an internal platform address

The toggle is also available in the portal (Environments → *Internal only*). Once set, it flows through promotions and rollbacks automatically.

> ⚠️ Switching an existing public environment to `is_private: true` **removes** all public routing and DNS. Existing traffic will be dropped.


## Forcing HTTPS

By default an environment answers on both HTTP and HTTPS. A visitor who types the
bare domain therefore stays on plain HTTP until your app redirects them — if it
does at all.

Set `force_https: true` to have the platform answer port 80 with a `301` to the
same URL over HTTPS:

```yaml
environments:
  prod:
    force_https: true
```

It can also be set per run from the workflow, which overrides the config file:

```yaml
- uses: pushed-cloud/pushed-actions/deploy@v1
  with:
    force_https: 'true'
```

The order is: the workflow input first, then `force_https` in `.base/config.yaml`,
then whatever is already set in the portal. Leaving the workflow input out does
not mean "change nothing" — if config.yaml sets `force_https`, that value is
still sent. To keep the portal's current setting, leave it out of both.

Either place must be `true` or `false`. An unrecognised workflow input fails the
deploy rather than being ignored; an unrecognised value in config.yaml is
skipped with a warning in the job log.

Certificate renewals are unaffected: the ACME challenge is served on its own
exact path, which takes precedence over the redirect.

**Do not enable this if your domain sits behind Cloudflare in "Flexible" SSL
mode.** In that mode Cloudflare fetches your origin over plain HTTP, so it would
receive the redirect, send the visitor to HTTPS, fetch the origin over HTTP
again, and loop. Cloudflare's "Full" and "Full (strict)" modes are unaffected —
and `Full (strict)` is the correct setting, since the platform serves a valid
certificate on the origin.
